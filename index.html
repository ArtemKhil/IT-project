    <p>
       <b> Côte De Boeuf is a steak cut from the rib primal with the rib bone still attached but depending on where you live it will have different names. In French cuisine the same cut also with bone attached is called côte de bœuf, which translates as “beef rib”. In Australia and New Zealand a bone-in rib steak is called a “ribeye”. In the USA it is known as a rib steak or cowboy steak. It delivers amazing flavour from all the marbling that runs through it, and makes an ideal sharing steak for a dinner for two. Chimichurri is mainly made from chopped parsley, garlic, olive oil, oregano, chilli flakes, and red wine vinegar. It’s great to use as a condiment for the meat, but can also be used as a marinade.</b>
